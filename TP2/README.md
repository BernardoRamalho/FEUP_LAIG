## Project information

- Main Strong points
  - Complexity of the xml Player and Goalkeeper nodes;
  - Node class;
  - Primitive parsing that doens't need any pre-process before drawing;
  - Complexity of the Player animation (There are various animation applied to the body and its parts at the same time), which shows a good XML hierarchy;
  - Barrel as custom values that make him rounder then what the examples given to us make;
  - Animation doesn't start at instant 0, so it can wait for the scene to fully load. This makes the animation easier to see from start to finish.
  - Our spriteText represents transparent background accurately.

- Scene
  - The scene ilustrates a part of a footbal stadium. In it we can see a goal, a goalkeeper, a player, a ball and some part of the stadium's stands. The player is kicking the ball trying to score a goal;
  - We can also see banners in each corner of the turf along side a score board and some publicity near the goal;
  - The animation consists of the player scoring a goal while the goalkeeper is trying to defend it. The ball enter the goal and bounces on the flour. When the ball enters the goal, the score board changes from 0-0 to 1-0. We can also see the moon near the score board.
